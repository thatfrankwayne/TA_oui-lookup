### v1.2.2
In October 2024, the IEEE site was found to sometimes produce strange responses. I changed the saved search that updates the OUI table to avoid overwriting with an empty result. (Thank you to GitHub's p4tpr0 for bringing this to my attention.)

### v1.2.1
Updated .meta for cloud compatibility.

Made minor cleanup edits (no functional changes).

### v1.2.0
The initial Splunkbase release.
